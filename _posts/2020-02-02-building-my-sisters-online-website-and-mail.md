My sister asked me to build a **professional website**, so I managed to do this with only 16$ for 2 years a domain name subscription. <br>
It's a simple **static website** built using bootstrap and html/css. Hosted for free on github pages.
I've used formspree.io to handle the email contact form backend. 


# Process
* Registered .com domain at namecheap for 16$ 
* Connected github pages to namecheap **DNS**
* Linked domain to cloudflare for encryption using **HTTPS** and **DDOS** protection  
* Used namecheap mail forwarding to send and receive **business mail** on gmail (info@russomakeup.com)
